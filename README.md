# [phytotron 🪴📋](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytotron)

a greenhouse board application submitting bot

## Project Status

⚠️ This project is still in development and not yet ready for use. ⚠️

## Requirements

- Python 3.13

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yoonthegoon/phytotron.git
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The bot will be unable to scrape Google as the default settings by scrapy are:

```python
# phytotron/settings.py

USER_AGENT = "Scrapy/2.12.0 (+https://scrapy.org)"  # L16
ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = True  # L19
DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS = {  # L39-L43
    "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8",
    "Accept-Language": "en",
}
```

I cannot suggest you change those in [settings.py](/phytotron/settings.py) to get around
Google's [robots.txt](https://www.google.com/robots.txt), but it is something that can be done.

Add a `phytotron.toml` to the project root directory.

```

## Usage

Run the bot.

```shell
python -m phytotron
```

An `items.csv` will be written in the project root directory.
It contains the URL and labels of the missing required fields of all the applications it failed to submit.

Fill in the inputs for each field rerun the bot with:

```shell
python -m phytotron rerun
```

It will go to all the failed application submissions and resubmit them with your new field inputs.
